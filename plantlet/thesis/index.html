As agriculture is a vital source for providing food, whereas crop ailments are major commination to agriculture, and their early detection remains strenuous over the globe due to insufficient technology, agricultural organizations are unable to reach farmers in time for necessary precautionary measures. As a result, farmers have to suffer from compromised lower crop yield. Many machine learning models were used to detect and identify diseases of plants but, after the advancement in Deep Learning, this field seems to have great potential concerning improved accuracy. The combination of advancements in computer vision and the global smartphone penetration made possible by deep learning to provide a mobile-phone-based system to diagnose diseases. Using a public data-set of <strong>87,900</strong> photos of healthy and diseased leaves, several models were trained to identify <strong>14</strong> crops and the presence or absence of <strong>26</strong> diseases, with the best performance reaching a <strong>98.58%</strong> on the retained dataset, which demonstrates the practicality of our perspective. Generally, the methodology of training deep convolutional neural networks on exceptionally huge and publicly accessible image data-sets presents a straightforward path towards a massive global diagnosis of mobile-phone-assisted crop disease.</p> <h2 id="chapter-1-introduction"><a href="#chapter-1-introduction" class="header-anchor">#</a> Chapter 1: Introduction</h2> <p>Earth is occupying more than 7 billion people. The number is increasing gradually.
With a persistent increase in population, it is understood that basic life necessities
are also increasing in which food is on top of the list. The increasing population
has also eaten up the land, and the area for agricultural land is shrinking up.
So we have to get an adequate amount of food from the land available. Food
sustainability, however, remains endanger by a variety of factors which includes
climate change [5], plant diseases [23] and others. When the plants are growing up,
they are attacked by diseases which clearly means a compromised lower crop yield.
Unfortunately, smallholder farmers have to face the disastrous consequences whose
income entirely depends upon crops. Yield. The major agricultural production
comes from smallholder farmers [9], and they have to suffer approximately 50%
yield loss due to climate change, pest attack, and diseases. Acknowledging these
problems, various attempts have been made to avert or lower the loss of crop yield.
To prevent the disease, it is crucial to detect the disease at an early stage. And
efficient disease management is a very crucial step in this regard. Agricultural
organizations have been working for disease detection at an early stage at local
clinics. During the past decades the world has totally turned into ”Global Village”
and because of that enormous data is available online including information on
disease diagnosis [11] and the leverage of which is internet penetration worldwide.
More recently, mobile phone technology incredibly has become famous due to the
proliferation of mobile-based tools in all parts of the world. All these factors
escort us to a point where disease detection is technically feasible and available at
an unparalleled scale. Unlike other countries, Pakistan lacks modern technology
due to which, we are unable to detect diseases in time and to reach farmers in
order to raise awareness about rehabilitation. The blue-collar approaches make
it very slow for policy-making organizations to gather data and draw results for
immediate movement. The intensity behind this research work is to dispense
an efficient system that can detect the disease straight-away whether a farmer
or agricultural organization uses it. We intended to develop mobile as well as
a web-based tool using deep learning for the detection of crop diseases. Deep
learning has proved its worth successfully in many different domains such as
end-to-end learning. Now we are going to demonstrate the technical feasibility of our
proposed approach by utilizing 87,900 images on healthy and infected leaves of
crop plants that are openly available on the online system PlantVillage [2].</p> <p><img src="/thesis/ExampleDatasetImages.jpg" alt="Sample leaf images from the dataset" title="Sample leaf images from the dataset"></p><hr> <span style="text-align:center;display:block;"><strong>Figure 1.1:</strong> Sample leaf images from the dataset</span> <hr><p></p> <p>A DCNN includes the mapping between an input to an output. Deep learning
is probability-based means it never gives us the definite answer however it gives
us the probabilities. The term CNN itself stipulates that a mathematical function called convolution is used within the network. Convolution is a specific type
mathematical operation on two functions which produces a third function that
expresses how another changes one’s form. A CNN consists of two main input and
output layers, and multiple hidden layers. Typically the hidden layers consist of
a series of convolutionary layers. The activation function is commonly a Rectified
Linear Units (RELU). The purpose of RELU is to normalize the values after the
application of convolution to convert the values in a specific range. Additional
convolutions such as pooling, fully connected layers and normalization layers follow the RELU. Pooling is to choose the best or one thing out of the pool of things.
The nodes in neural networks are computational units which take weighted inputs
from the incoming edges and provide an outgoing edge with numerical output.
node enumerates an output value by adding a specific function to the previous
layer’s input values. In a neural network, model learning progresses through iterative changes to these weights and biases. DCNN is learned by changing network
parameters in such a way as to improve mapping during the training. For thepurpose of plant disease identification, we needed a large and verified data-set of
healthy and diseased images to train an accurate image classifier, but such dataset
did not exist until very recently, and even small dataset were not publicly available. In order to tackle this issue, the PlantVillage project began to collect a large
dataset of diseased and healthy crop plants and made them available publicly. We
announce here on the classification of 26 diseases (presence or absence) in 14 crop
species using 87,900 with deep learning (DL).</p> <h2 id="chapter-2-motivation-and-problem-statement"><a href="#chapter-2-motivation-and-problem-statement" class="header-anchor">#</a> Chapter 2: Motivation and Problem Statement</h2> <h3 id="_2-1-motivation"><a href="#_2-1-motivation" class="header-anchor">#</a> 2.1: Motivation</h3> <p>With the increase in population, the needs have also been increased.

prevent farmers from suffering a loss to some extent.</p> <h3 id="_2-2-problem-statement"><a href="#_2-2-problem-statement" class="header-anchor">#</a> 2.2: Problem Statement</h3> <p>Plant disease affects not only the production of human food but also natural
systems. The majority of smallholder farmers do not have access to the resources
that can identify the diseases accurately and timely. Due to the lack of timely and
accurate agricultural information, they have to suffer from lower crop yield.</p> <h2 id="chapter-3-literature-review"><a href="#chapter-3-literature-review" class="header-anchor">#</a> Chapter 3: Literature Review</h2> <p>The Deep Learning (DL) is subcategory of ML. This field is still evolving. Machine
Learning has made enormous evolution in the past few years. Many advances were
found in the first phase, such as handwritten text recognition, back-propagation
and resolving training problems. In the second phase was to develop algorithms
for health-sectors, text-recognition, earthquake-predictions, marketing, finance,
image-recognition, and object detection. In 2012 a deep convolutionary neural
network accomplished a top-5 error of 15.3% when classifying images into 1000
possible categories [1]. In the next three years, numerous advances in convolutionary neural networks reduced the error rate to 3.57. With the passage of time as
Deep Learning architectures started to evolve, researchers applied them to classification, segmentation, object detection, video processing, natural language processing, image recognition, and speech recognition. Different agriculture application
has also been developed using these architectures. For example, Leaf counting was
performed using Deep CNN with average accuracy of 95% [25]. Leaf classification
was performed using deep convolutional neural network classifier among 32 different species with average accuracy of 97.3% [7]. Fruit counting was performed by
using simulated deep convolutional neural network with an average accuracy of
91% [19]. Classification of land cover and crop type was performed by using deep
learning classifier with accuracy of crop type identification of 95% [18]. Identification of plants was performed by using Deep convolutional neural network [10, 16].
In [26] identification of plants was performed among 100 different species utilizing
10,000 images using deep learning with an accuracy of 91.78%. In addition deep
learning techniques are also used in for crucial tasks such as crop plant disease
identification and classification which is main topic of this thesis. For example,
in [20] plant disease detection was performed using deep convolutional neural network classifier. To sum up, used DL Architectures are shown in the table along with the selected plants and their results.</p> <table><thead><tr><th>Deep Learning Techniques</th> <th>Dataset</th> <th>Used Plants</th> <th>Accuracy</th> <th>Reference</th></tr></thead> <tbody><tr><td>Convolutional Neural Network</td> <td>Plant Village </td> <td>Maize</td> <td>92.85%</td> <td>[21]</td></tr> <tr><td>LeNet</td> <td>Plant Village </td> <td>Banana</td> <td>98.54%</td> <td>[4]</td></tr> <tr><td>Alex-Net, VGG16, VGG-19, Squeeze-Net, Goog-LeNet, Inception-v-3, Inception-ResNet-v-2, ResNet-50, Resnet-101 </td> <td>Real Field Dataset</td> <td>Apricot, Walnut, Peach, Cherry </td> <td>97.14%</td> <td>[24]</td></tr> <tr><td>Inception-v-3 </td> <td>Experimental Field Dataset </td> <td>Cassava </td> <td>93%</td> <td>[3]</td></tr> <tr><td>Convolutional Neural Network</td> <td>Images Taken From The Research Center </td> <td>Cucumber </td> <td>82.3%</td> <td>[8]</td></tr> <tr><td>Super Resolution Convolutional Neural Network (SCRNN)</td> <td>Plant Village </td> <td>Tomato </td> <td>90%</td> <td>[15]</td></tr> <tr><td>Caffe-Net</td> <td>Downloaded From The Internet </td> <td>Pear, cherry, peach, apple, grapevine </td> <td>96.3%</td> <td>[22]</td></tr> <tr><td>Resnet-50, Inception-V-2, Mobile-Net-V-1 </td> <td>Real Environment </td> <td>Banana </td> <td>99% of ResNet-50</td> <td>[17]</td></tr> <tr><td>Mobile-Net, Modified-Mobile-Net, Reduced-Mobile-Net</td> <td>Plant Village dataset</td> <td>24 Types Of Plants</td> <td>98.34% of reduced MobileNet </td> <td>[14]</td></tr></tbody></table> <hr> <span style="text-align:center;display:block;"><strong>Table 3.1:</strong> DL Architectures along with selected plant species and results</span> <hr> <p>From this table, we can conclude that while some Deep Learning Architectures/-
Models have been developed for the identification of the diseases of plants but this
is still a prolific research field and should lead to improvements for better plant
disease identification. So we needed a large and verified data set of healthy and
diseased images to train an accurate image classifier for plant disease diagnosis,
but such a dataset did not exist until very recently. Plant Village collected a huge
dataset of 87,900 images of plant health to enable the development of smartphone
assisted disease diagnosis and made it publicly and freely available [12].</p> <h2 id="chapter-4-materials-and-methods"><a href="#chapter-4-materials-and-methods" class="header-anchor">#</a> Chapter 4: Materials and Methods</h2> <h3 id="_4-1-materials"><a href="#_4-1-materials" class="header-anchor">#</a> 4.1: Materials</h3> <p>Our dataset is consists of 87,900 pictures of healthy and diseased plant leaves.
