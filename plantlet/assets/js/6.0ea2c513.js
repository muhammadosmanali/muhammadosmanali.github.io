Food\nsustainability, however, remains endanger by a variety of factors which includes\nclimate change [5], plant diseases [23] and others.

Acknowledging these\nproblems, various attempts have been made to avert or lower the loss of crop yield.\nTo prevent the disease, it is crucial to detect the disease at an early stage. And\nefficient disease management is a very crucial step in this regard. Agricultural\norganizations have been working for disease detection at an early stage at local\nclinics.

A CNN consists of two main input and\noutput layers, and multiple hidden layers. Typically the hidden layers consist of\na series of convolutionary layers. The activation function is commonly a Rectified\nLinear Units (RELU). The purpose of RELU is to normalize the values after the\napplication of convolution to convert the values in a specific range. Additional\nconvolutions such as pooling, fully connected layers and normalization layers follow the RELU. Pooling is to choose the best or one thing out of the pool of things.\nThe nodes in neural networks are computational units which take weighted inputs\nfrom the incoming edges and provide an outgoing edge with numerical output.\nnode enumerates an output value by adding a specific function to the previous\nlayer’s input values.
